    Added portgroup API support. API version was bumped to 1.17. The following
    new endpoints are added:
    - /nodes/<node_ident>/portgroups
    - /portgroups
    - /portgroups/<portgroup_ident>
    - /portgroups/<portgroup_ident>/ports
    Starting with this API version, ports have three new fields:
    - portgroup_uuid contains UUID of a portgroup this port belongs to;
    - pxe_enabled indicates whether pxe is enabled or disabled on the node;
    - local_link_connection contains the port binding profile.
